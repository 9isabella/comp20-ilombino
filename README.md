COMP 20 Spring 2019 Private Repo for Isabella Lombino

This purpose of this repo is to show all the work that I completed during Comp20 in the spring of my freshmen year at Tufts (2019). 
It provides some good examples of work I have completed and what I am capable of creating at this stage. 

I really enjoyed working on the knockoff lift project because it was a little more complicated and really got me thinking about how a 
lot of different topics can all be combined. 

I have grown A LOT since day one. Before taking this course, I knew a little bit about HTML, CSS, and very basic Javascript, but really
had no sense of what goes on behind the scenes. This course allowed me to really understand web development and see all the possibile ways
in which it can be applied. 

The most important thing I have learned is probably the request response model. Before this class I didn't really understand how the web
worked, but this gave me a good foundation in this subject matter. Learning and understanding the diagram for this was very important for me
as well as seeing directly how this model transfers into the code. 

Honestly, I want to delve deeper into almost everything we learned. I still feel like I do not fully understand databases though, so I would
especially like to learn more about databases.
