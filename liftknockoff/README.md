I believe that all aspects of this project have been correctly implimented. I will say that I was unable to test the
the finished product as both a passenger and a vehicle because of when I finished working on it, 
but to the best of my knowledge it works for both. 
I got minor aid from Sam Cohen (who is currently taking Comp11), but the vast majority was completed by myself. 
I'm not sure how long I spent on the assignment but I would guess around 8 hours. 

Note: I used a token on this assignment.
