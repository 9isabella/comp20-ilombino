Homer goes into and comes back out of the bushes correctly as the screen size is adjusted. Also, only one
image was used for this (a sprite sheet). I believe that I have completed all aspects of this lab. 

I did not work with anyone else on this lab. However, I did get help from a friend (Sam Cohen) to set up Bash on my computer and get the ssh key to work. 

Doing the actual assignment took me approximately an hour. However, I have spent an additional 3ish hours trying to figure out the ssh key.
