        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <P>
            I have been hired to find the vulnerabilities in the knockoff lift that my partner created. 
            His product is supposed to allow users to connect with passengers (if they are a driver) and vehicles (if they are a passenger).
            In order to do this, it stores some data about each user requesting a ride into a database. I will try to break the system he has created. 
            In doing this task, I will hopefully allow him to understand where he needs to improve the security of the site. 
        </P>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
            I started off by using curl to navigate his website. I then began to poke around even further with curl, trying different ways to
            get into the website. Considering the limited security precautions in place, this was a relatively straightforward task. 
        </p>
        <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
        <p>
            I found three major vulnerabilities in the knockoff lift site I was given. First off, I was able to see everyone's data. 
            Ideally I should only see the data for a particular username, but I was able to bypass this and see everyone's data at once. 
            Next, I was able to make a popup window appear on the page. Although my window was not malicious, this demonstrates how someone could 
            infultrate the website and make whatever they wanted appear on the screen. 
        </p>
        <h3>Issues Found</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>XSS in username post route</h5>
                <p>This is a high severity issue because it allows anyone to insert any script into the database which is then executed when the
                    passenger.json get route is run. Although my script was just a simple alert, a malicious user could very easily insert a script that
                    caused real damage. I found the issue by observing that there was no validation in the post route username field. This meant that I was
                    able to insert anything as a username, including a script. The issue could be resolved by using a validator which would remove any 
                    special characters. 
                </p>
