    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <P>
        I have been hired to find the vulnerabilities in the knockoff lift that my partner created.
        His product is supposed to allow users to connect with passengers (if they are a driver) and vehicles (if they
        are a passenger).
        In order to do this, it stores some data about each user requesting a ride into a database. I will try to break
        the system he has created.
        In doing this task, I will hopefully allow him to understand where he needs to improve the security of the site.
    </P>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
        I started off by using curl to navigate his website. I then began to poke around even further with curl, trying
        different ways to
        get into the website. I also read his code thoroughly to see if I could find any places in which he was not checking all cases (for example not checking 
        if a variable was null).
        Considering the limited security precautions in place, I did not need to use any special software for this.
    </p>
    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
    <p>
        I found three major vulnerabilities in the knockoff lift site I was given. First off, I was able to see
        everyone's data.
        Ideally I should only see the data for a particular username, but I was able to bypass this and see everyone's
        data at once.
        Next, I was able to make a popup window appear on the page. Although my window was not malicious, this
        demonstrates how someone could
        infultrate the website and make whatever they wanted appear on the screen. Lastly, I found that if I did not send in coordinates, 
        the map will not load properly.
    </p>
    <h3>Issues Found</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>XSS in username post route</h5>
            <p>This is a high severity issue because it allows anyone to insert any script into the database which is
                then executed when the
                passenger.json get route is run. Although my script was just a simple alert, a malicious user could very
                easily insert a script that
                caused real damage. I found the issue by observing that there was no validation in the post route
                username field. This meant that I was
                able to insert anything as a username, including a script. The issue could be resolved by using a
                validator which would remove any
                special characters. First you'd have to require  the npm validator package and then use: username = validator.escape(username);

        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Undefined error in console through lat/lng post route</h5>
            <p>This is a medium severity issue because it prevents the map from working (which is the whole point of the website),
                but it does not cause a malicious attack. I found the issue by not entering in lat and/or lng in the curl post route.
                This does not prevent the data from being stored in the database as it should (which is bad coding practice),
                and instead just stores in null. The code only checks to make sure that lat, lng, and username are not undefined, so 
                it does not catch the null values. Then, when Google Maps tries to render the map, this null value is read as undefined
                and prevents the map from showing any icons, giving a console error (as seen below). This error could be corrected if 
                instead of only checking to make sure lat, lng, and username are not undefined, also checking to make sure they are not null: 
                if(username != undefined && username != null && lat != undefined && lat != null && lng != undefined && lng != null)
            </p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Database leakage in passenger.json</h5>
            <p>This is a high severity issue because it allows a user to see everyone's data rather than just their own. This database contains locational 
                information which you would not want anyone who was not verified to get hold of, as they could use the data to track a user. In some database 
                leaks of this sort, the issue could be even more severe if the database was storing highly sensitive data such as social security numbers. I 
                discovered the issue by inserting [$ne] into the query string of passenger.json get route. This essentially shows all the passengers that are NOT the one 
                username actually entered. In order to prevent against this, the key should 
                also be checked, rather than just the value. This would prevent changing the key by adding [$ne] and having it still work. 

                (Please note that the DIE NOW at the beginning of the screenshot is simply from the XSS vulnerability mentioned earlier and unrelated to this vulnerability.)

    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In the future, extra precaution should be taken to make sure that the database is only storing information that is meant to be stored. This means 
        making sure that all data has been validated and that any missing data is not simply stored as null or undefined (unless this is done on purpose). 
        It is also important to make sure the database information is only accessible by those who are supposed to access it. This means checking keys as well
        as the values of those keys. It is important to remember CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>For this work, I only used the code I was given by Quinn. I did not use any outside resources such as Burp Suite or Zap. I did of course get 
        a lot of information about how to attack the site from class lectures in Comp20!
